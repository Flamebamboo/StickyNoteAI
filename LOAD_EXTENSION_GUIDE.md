# 🚀 How to Load the New StickyNoteAI Extension

## Step 1: Open Chrome Extensions
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Go to: `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn ON "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)

## Step 2: Remove Old Version (if any)
- If you see StickyNoteAI already installed, click "Remove" to delete it
- This prevents conflicts with the old version

## Step 3: Load New Version
1. Click "Load unpacked" button
2. Navigate to your project folder: `StickyNoteAI 10.05.32 AM`
3. Select the folder: `.output/chrome-mv3-dev/`
4. Click "Select" or "Open"

## Step 4: Verify It's Working
1. Go to any website (like google.com)
2. Open browser DevTools: F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Click "Console" tab
4. Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
5. Look for this message: "🎯 StickyNoteAI v2.0 NEW CIRCULAR UI - Loading..."

## Step 5: Test the New UI
- Look for a ✨ button in the top-right corner of the webpage
- **Hover** over it → Should see circular menu appear below
- **Drag** it → Should move smoothly without lag
- Menu should have: ➕ 📋 ⚙️ ❌ buttons in a vertical column

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the ✨ button:
1. Make sure you loaded from `.output/chrome-mv3-dev/` folder
2. Refresh the webpage after loading extension
3. Check Console for the "NEW CIRCULAR UI" message

### If you see old UI:
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Clear extension data:
   - Go to chrome://extensions/
   - Click "Details" on StickyNoteAI
   - Scroll down, click "Clear all data"
   - Refresh webpage

### If buttons don't appear on hover:
- Make sure you're hovering over the ✨ button, not dragging it
- Try clicking once on the ✨ button to see if menu appears

## ✅ Success Signs
- ✨ Purple gradient main button (50px, different from others)
- White circular menu buttons (40px, same size)
- Vertical menu layout (not horizontal)
- Smooth drag without lag
- Console message: "🎯 StickyNoteAI v2.0 NEW CIRCULAR UI - Loading..."

## 📁 Correct Folder Structure
Make sure you're loading from:
```
StickyNoteAI 10.05.32 AM/
└── .output/
    └── chrome-mv3-dev/  ← Load THIS folder
        ├── manifest.json
        ├── content-scripts/
        │   └── content.js
        └── icon/
```

If you still don't see the new UI, send me a screenshot of:
1. Your Chrome extensions page 
2. The browser console when you load a webpage
3. What you see on the webpage
