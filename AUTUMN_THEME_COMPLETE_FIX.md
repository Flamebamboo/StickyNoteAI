## Technical Fixes Applied

### Main Button Isolation:
```typescript
// Force complete isolation of main button
mainBtnElement.style.cssText = `
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #22c55e 0%, #16a34a 100%) !important;
  border: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) !important;
  color: white !important;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.3) !important;
  position: relative !important;
`;
```

### Widget Container Clearing:
```typescript
// Clear any widget-level styling that could affect main button
widget.style.background = '';
widget.style.border = '';
widget.style.color = '';
```

### Menu Container Enhancement:
```typescript
// Proper menu styling with better appearance
menuElement.style.borderRadius = '12px';
menuElement.style.padding = '8px';
menuElement.style.background = 'autumn gradient';
createAreaLeavesBackground(menuElement, 'widget');
```

### Theme Application Timing:
```typescript
// Proper timing for theme application to recent notes panel
setTimeout(() => {
  applyThemeToWidgetAndPanels(currentTheme.id);
}, 50);
```
